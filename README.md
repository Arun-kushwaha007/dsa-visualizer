# DSA Visual Interpreter

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing the execution of C++ code, with a focus on data structures and algorithms. It provides a LeetCode-like interface with a code editor on the right and a real-time visualization panel on the left.

## Features


- **Split-screen layout**: A familiar and intuitive UI with a code editor and a visualization panel.
- **Code editor**: A powerful code editor with syntax highlighting for C++.
- **Real-time visualization**: See the execution of your code step by step.
- **Data structure visualization**: Visualize a variety of data structures, including:
  - Variables (int, string, char, bool, double)
  - Arrays and vectors
  - Stacks
  - Queues
- **Loop and condition visualization**: Understand how loops and conditional statements are executed.

## How to use

1. **Write your C++ code** in the code editor on the right.
2. **Click the "Parse" button** to parse your code.
3. **Click the "Next Step" button** to execute the code step by step and see the visualization on the left.
